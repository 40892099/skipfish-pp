# skipfishblack

forked copy of skipfish

priorities of this fork:
- more invasive/dangerous tests
- expand the dictionary format to allow granular control of fuzz/test data
- more debug output
- add more tests (esp. passively discoverable)
- remove tests which are low-yield
- extend skipfish, but don't remove or break any existing things (with exception for trimming poor ROI testing)
